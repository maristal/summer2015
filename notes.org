  ** Diamond detector versus silicon diode and ion chamber in photon beams of different energy and field size

    *** Advantages of diamond detector
      - the high sensitivity of diamond material permits to build small size dosimeters suitable  for accurate  determination  of  output  factors,  percent depth dose and transverse profiles, also when field sizes are small,  which  is  the  condition  where  ion  chambers  do  not have an appropriate spatial resolution
     - Its features compare favorably with those of ion chamber and silicon diode systems. In fact, . Its tissue equivalence  does  not  introduce  an  energy  dependence  effect  in  the  response, which, on the contrary, can be present in silicon diodes.

    *** Drawbacks to be considered in the use of diamond detector
    - signal shows a dose rate dependence that must be accounted for in order  to  obtain  correct  dose  distributions,  while  the  results here  reported  exclude  such  dependence  for  silicon
    - it  is less user friendly, since it necessitates a pre-irradiation dose, before daily use, to stabilize the response
    - it has a slow  response  in  time,  needing  up  to  about 2 s to obtain signal  stability,
