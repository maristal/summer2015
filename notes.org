* Summary of previous theoretical work done
** (RadMon) The new version of Radiation Monitor system for the electronics at CERN.
*** RadFet
  - Total Ionizing Dose with RadFet
  - 100 nm higher TID range
  - 400 nm higher resolution
  - changing of the bias voltage leads to changes in threshold voltage, change is not linear with TID, calibration is needed
  - relation between drain current and drain-source potential is used to measure variation of threshold voltage at different doses
  - 100nm linear fit valid up to 100 Gy, 400nm fit valid up to 100 Gy
  - CONTENT
*** SRAM
  - High Energy Hadron Fluence with SRAM

** Measurement of the n-TOF beam profile with a micromegas detector

** Diamond detector versus silicon diode and ion chamber in photon beams of different energy and field size

*** Advantages of a diamond detector
  - the high sensitivity of diamond material permits to build small size dosimeters suitable  for accurate  determination  of  output  factors,  percent depth dose and transverse profiles, also when field sizes are small,  which  is  the  condition  where  ion  chambers  do  not have an appropriate spatial resolution
 - Its features compare favorably with those of ion chamber and silicon diode systems. Its tissue equivalence  does  not  introduce  an  energy  dependence  effect  in  the  response, which, on the contrary, can be present in silicon diodes.

*** Drawbacks to be considered in the use of the diamond detector
- signal shows a dose rate dependence that must be accounted for in order  to  obtain  correct  dose  distributions,  while  the  results here  reported  exclude  such  dependence  for  silicon
- it  is less user friendly, since it necessitates a pre-irradiation dose, before daily use, to stabilize the response
- it has a slow  response  in  time,  needing  up  to  about 2 s to obtain signal  stability,
